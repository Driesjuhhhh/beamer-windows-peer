# An ad-hoc build is a different code identity on every build wearing the same bundle id. macOS
# keeps the old grant against the old identity, which is why such a reinstall can sit in the
# Privacy pane with a tick beside it and still receive no events -- the tick belongs to a build
# that no longer exists. Revoking turns that silent failure into a visible prompt.
# Only ad-hoc builds need it. build_dmg.sh signs with a real identity where one
# is reachable, and that identity is stable across rebuilds, so the grants carry over and
# revoking them would throw away the very thing the signing bought. The ad-hoc path still
# exists for builds driven over SSH, where the login keychain cannot be unlocked.
# Resetting resolves the id through LaunchServices, so it runs after the new bundle is in place,
# and never blocks the install: a first install on a clean machine has nothing to revoke.
