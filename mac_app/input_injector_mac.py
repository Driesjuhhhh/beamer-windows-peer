"""Quartz CGEvent keyboard and mouse injection, the Mac twin of
win_app/input_injector.py.

`receiver.py` calls the same five functions on either machine. The wire's key
names are already Mac-shaped -- "cmd" is Command here and the Windows key
there -- so the Windows capture does the semantic mapping before sending and
nothing is translated on arrival.

Every event posted from here carries INJECTED_MARK in its source user data,
which is how bridge.py's event tap tells Beamer's own injection apart from
a real hand on the Mac's own keyboard or trackpad: without that the tap
would read a pointer the PC is driving as a push against the Mac's crossing
edge and switch input straight back.

Quartz is imported at module level and guarded the same way clipboard_mac
guards AppKit, so this module stays importable, and its behaviour fakeable,
on a machine without it.
