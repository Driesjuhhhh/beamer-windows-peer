"""Unlock a locked Windows console so injected input has somewhere to land.

Beamer cannot type on the lock screen and never will: that is the Winlogon
secure desktop, whose security descriptor admits only SYSTEM, and SendInput
only reaches the desktop its calling thread is attached to. Running elevated
clears UIPI, not desktop access -- which is why an admin Beamer still cannot
touch a locked machine.

So this module does not inject into the lock screen. It asks Room Deck's
credential provider to take the machine *off* the lock screen, after which
the console is back on the Default desktop and the ordinary
input_injector.py path works unchanged.

The provider (Room-Deck/room-deck-agent/provider) is a COM DLL that LogonUI
loads as SYSTEM. It waits on an auto-reset event and, when signalled,
submits the password stored in a machine-DPAPI blob. Its event's DACL grants
Authenticated Users EVENT_MODIFY_STATE, so an unelevated Beamer can signal it
and no Beamer process ever holds a password.

Room Deck owns the provider; Beamer only knocks. Shipping a second provider
would put two waiters on one auto-reset event, and losing that race is the
exact bug that cost Room Deck a day (see its 28-08-2026 doc). If the
provider is not installed, every call here fails cleanly and Beamer behaves
as it did before.

Guarded like clipboard_win.py and input_injector.py so it stays importable,
and its orchestration testable, on a machine without ctypes.windll.
